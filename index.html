    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Hello there, welcome to my resume. This is a website I have created
    to showcase my skills and experience in web development. I am constantly learning about new techniques,
    and I aim to stay up-to-date on the latest technologies to improve the way I create projects on the internet.
    If you're interested in collobaration, it will definetely help improve my experience
    when it comes to working with other people. Feel free to contact me if interested.
    Below, you will find information regarding my experience level in certain
    areas, which will help you determine if I'm best fit for a project you are looking to collaborate.
    Thank you for visiting my resume, that is ought to be updated in the near future.</p>
    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>Currently, I am in high school. My goal is to graduate college and continue to help
    others by collaboration. Once I graduate high school, I aim to increase the time I spend on
    learning web development skills significantly, and I hope to participate in
    projects, whether it's a simple website, or perhaps something more challenging.
    My goals in life however, are not just nested in coding. One day, in the relatively near future,
    I aspire to become an airline pilot, as I have great interests in the field of aviation.
    I believe that pursuing web development as a skill will help me financially in the long-run to
    pursue this ambitious goal. Additionally,
    I believe that learning web development skills, especially during the era of
    rapidly growing artificial intelligence technologies, will benefit me by keeping me up-to-date
    on what will continue to shape our world in the near future, which greatly matters to me.</p>
    <h4>Work experience?</h4>
    <p>I have absolutely no work experience, which I certainly believe to not be true
    forever. I take my time seriously, and one of my most important goals in life is to start working
    in the web development field. When I do start working, and get the time to manage
    my work and personal lives effectively, I will put in my best effort, utilizing my
    prior experience in programming to create something you and I can both be proud of.
    If something is unfamiliar to me, or there is something new that I should learn, I will not
    hesitate to do my research. The projects I will be creating in the near future
    will most likely be capstone projects, which are projects that simulate tasks given to me, and they will help build
    my experience in the web development field by teaching me new and important things.</p>
    <h4>Skills</h4>
    <p>I've recently started learning skills in web development, and I plan on continuing
    this proccess by watching courses and applying what I learn from them. I will create capstone 
    projects and learn new things along the way. This is my first website being hosted on the internet.
    I am always looking forward to learn something new, and once I rank up my skills
    to a certain level, I will list them under this section.
